### 1.0.1-1.16.5-1.0

_Not Released Yet_

#### Requirements
- **MinecraftForge:** 1.16.5-36.2.2

#### Improvements

- Added MineColonies' citizens (`minecolonies:citizen`) to the default allowlist.
    - This will only take effect for new installations. If you wish to whitelist
      MineColonies' citizens to an existing installation, you will still have to
      add the exception manually.
- Improved documentation for configuration options.

#### Fixes

- Updated an error message to avoid potential confusion.
